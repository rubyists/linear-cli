# Investigation Stage

You are investigating issue **{{ issue.identifier }}**: {{ issue.title }}

**Current status:** {{ issue.state }}
**Labels:** {{ issue.labels }}
**URL:** {{ issue.url }}

## Issue description

{% if issue.description %}
{{ issue.description }}
{% else %}
No description provided.
{% endif %}

## Objective

Understand the problem thoroughly before any code is written.  Your output is
an investigation summary posted as a Linear comment — not code changes.

## First run

1. Read the issue description and any existing Linear comments.
2. Identify the relevant source files — read them, understand the architecture.
3. If the issue is a bug: reproduce it first (run the failing test or repro steps).
4. If the issue is a feature: map out which files/modules need changes.
5. Establish grounding before concluding anything:
   - Name every data source you read and how you proved it was that one.
   - If the issue quotes a number, reproduce it yourself. If your figure
     disagrees, that discrepancy IS the finding — report both.
   - If the data cannot answer the question, say so rather than substituting
     an adjacent field.
6. Write `.stokowski/report.json` covering:
   - `summary` — root cause, or requirements for a feature
   - `claims` — each finding with its evidence and a checkable source
   - `data_sources` — what you read and how you verified it
   - `risks`, `open_questions`, `assumptions`
   - `verdict` — `complete` when the approach is clear, `blocked` when it is not
   - `next` — the proposed approach in one or two sentences
   - `key_points` — 3-5 bullets giving the reasons behind that approach, and
     any caveat that would change it
   - `next_steps` — ordered actions for whoever implements it

   Those last four render at the very top of the Linear comment and are what
   the human at the gate reads first, so they must carry the recommendation on
   their own — someone who reads nothing else should know what to do and why.
   Stokowski posts this to Linear for you.
7. Post the summary as a Linear comment titled `## Investigation`.

## Rework run

If this is a rework run (the workspace already has investigation content):

1. Read the review feedback from Linear comments.
2. Read your prior investigation summary.
3. Address the specific feedback — expand analysis, correct mistakes, or
   investigate additional areas as requested.
4. Write a fresh `.stokowski/report.json` with the revised findings, and note

## Do NOT

- Write implementation code.
- Create branches or PRs.
- Modify source files (reading is fine).
- Post a summary comment on the issue — Stokowski does that from your report.
- Report a confident conclusion you could not source. Lower the confidence
  instead; `low` on a real finding beats `high` on a shaky one.

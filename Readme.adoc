A command line interface to https://linear.app.

== Installation

=== I don't want to install

You can use the OCI container image to run the CLI without installing it.

[source,sh]
----
$ podman run -w /git -v .:/git -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -it --rm -e GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_TOKEN" -e LINEAR_API_KEY="$LINEAR_API_KEY" ghcr.io/rubyists/linear-cli:stable lcls <1>
$ docker run -it --rm -e LINEAR_API_KEY=your-api-key ghcr.io/rubyists/linear-cli:stable lcls <2>
----
<1> Podman Usage
<2> Docker Usage, without mounting your ssh keys and git dir. This will not be able to do git operations.

There is a {plc-url}[helper script] available to wrap this up for you.

NOTE: Git commands will require a passphrase for every operation if you are using an ssh key.

[source,sh]
----
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubyists/linear-cli/main/oci/plc | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/lc
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lc
----

Then you can just run 'lc' to use the CLI.

=== Gem install (Most should use this)

Requires ruby 3.4 or later

[source,sh]
----
$ gem install linear-cli
----

=== From Source (You are obviously a developer)

[source,sh]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/rubyists/linear-cli.git
$ cd linear-cli
$ bundle install
$ rake install
----

== Usage

=== Configuration

You must set the LINEAR_API_KEY environment variable to your Linear API key.
You can find your API key in your https://linear.app/settings/api[Linear Settings].

==== Tab Completion

If you are using bash or zsh, you can enable tab completion by adding the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

bash:

[source,sh]
----
eval "$(lc completion bash)" <1>
eval "$(lc completion -a bash)" <2>
----
<1> This will enable tab completion for the 'lc' command in bash
<2> This will include the subcommand aliases as well

zsh:

[source,sh]
----
eval "$(lc completion zsh)" <1>
eval "$(lc completion -a zsh)" <2>
----
<1> This will enable tab completion for the 'lc' command in zsh
<2> This will include the subcommand aliases as well

=== Commands

==== Help

You can get help/usage for any command or subcommand by using the `--help` flag.

[source,sh]
----
$ lc --help
$ lc [COMMAND] --help
$ lc [COMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND] --help
----

==== Who Am I?

You can use the 'w' alias for 'whoami' (or whodat, for Saints fans)

[source,sh]
----
$ lc whoami
$ lc whodat <1>
$ lc w --teams <2>
----
<1> Bayou style
<2> Include the teams you are a member of

==== List Issues

`lcls` is a helper provided to list issues. It's an alias for `lc issues list`.

image::cinemas/listings.cinema.gif[]

[source,sh]
----
$ lcls
$ lcls --full
$ lcls -f CRY-1
----

==== Assign one or more issues to yourself (take em!)

'i' is a shortcut for the 'issue' command

[source,sh]
----
$ lc i take CRY-1234
$ lc issue take CRY-456 CRY-789
----

==== Create an issue

'c' is a shortcut for the 'create' subcommand of the issue command

[source,sh]
----
$ lc i c --title "My new issue" --description "This is a new issue" --labels Bug,Feature --team CRY
$ lc i c -t "My new issue" -T CRY -l Improvement,Feature
----

NOTE: If you don't provide a title, team, labels or description, you will be prompted to enter them.

TIP: When creating an issue, you can use the --dev option to immediately start development on the issue.

==== Develop an issue

This will switch to the branch for the issue, creating the branch if it doesn't exist.

'dev' is a shortcut for the 'develop' subcommand of the issue command

[source,sh]
----
$ lc i dev CRY-1234
----

===== Create a Pull Request (Using the Semantic PR Title)

Requires the `gh` cli to be installed and configured.

[source,sh]
----
$ lc i pr CRY-1234
----

==== Update an issue

All of the update options can work on multiple issues, so long as it's not more than 50
at a time. You can also use the 'u' alias for 'update', and as always, the 'i' alias for 'issue'.

===== Add a comment to one or more issues

[source,sh]
----
$ lc issue update --comment "Here is a comment" CRY-1234 <1>
$ lc issue u --close --reason "I do not like you" CRY-14 CRY-15 <2>
$ lc i u --cancel --trash --reason "I have no idea why you are here" CRY-16 CRY-17 <3>
$ lc i u --comment - CRY-14 CRY-15 <4>
$ lcomment CRY-1234 CRY-3 <5>
----
<1> This will use the provided comment to comment on the issue
<2> This will close multiple issues without prompting (reason is added as a comment)
<3> This will cancel multiple issues without prompting, and move them to the trash (reason is added as a comment)
<4> This will prompt for a comment (use '-' to prompt)
<5> This will always prompt you for a comment ('lcomment' is an alias for 'lc issue update --comment -')

===== Close one or many issues

[source,sh]
----
$ lc i u --close --reason "These were closable" CRY-1234 CRY-2
----

=== Aliases

Some command aliases are available to make things easier to type.

[source,sh]
----
$ lcls
$ lcreate --description "This is a new issue" --labels Bug,Feature --team CRY
$ lclose --reason "This issue sucks" CRY-1234 CRY-456
----

[source,bash]
